TODO is TODO
-----------------
This project started with normal jdk crate to remove repetead installation of java after machine crash, or 
new os installation or new machine or when new progs are hired at your company.

Needs to be updated to work seamlessly with vagrant.

The crate scripts need to be made intuitive and easier to work with gradually with time.

It will soon be a submoduled project on `prayagupd/dotfiles`.
